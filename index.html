    <h3>Nanran Corporation, Bookkeeper</h3>
    <h4>August 2020-August 2021</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>I worked with Excel and used it in every day tasks.</li>
    <li>I worked well with the team memebers in order to get reports sent out quickly and efficiently to management.</li>
    <li>I worked directly for the head accountant, and my job was to handle working with incorporating our last years labor and this yearâ€™s labor in order for the accountant to create the checks. We have not been late sending the checks to Florida due to our incompetence once.</li>
    <li>I did any other tasks with minimal complications that the head accountant passed onto me on a daily basis.</li>
    <li>When asked to do so, I went to pick up inventory in another town and came back to the town where the office is based out of. I then took inventory of what was purchased, while the stores reported what they needed to the head accountant, then was passed to me and I took the inventory to the stores.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Agricultural Farm, Maintenance Worker</h3>
    <h4>Summers 2014-Summers Present</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Starting out in 2014, I was fourteen years old and mowed as a way to make money. I mowed around 5 acres then.</li>
    <li>Every year, we incorporated more into what I would do as maintenance. Weed-eating, spraying for weeds, walking the fields of crops, and even tagging along to learn about planting and harvesting.</li>
    <li>Last year was the first year that I was still mowing, but instead of working one or two days, it was three or four. I helped out around the farm wherever I was needed. We do not have livestock, but we plant and harvest crops on an abundance of acreage.</li>
    <li>I help cut down trees and transport the limbs, lay concrete, drag fields, helped with the electric when building a cabin on our land, and help work on tractors and trailers when they need maintenance.</li>
    </ul>
